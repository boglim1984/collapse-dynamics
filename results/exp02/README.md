# Experiment 02 Results

This directory contains the visual output for the Lyapunov Stability Scan.

## Required Assets
Place the following image in this directory:
- `download-1.png`: The summary chart showing the 4 stability channels (lambda_state, lambda_commit, log-gain, raw sensitivity).

*Note: The user will manually copy this from `/Volumes/T7/pschometrics stress/download-1.png` or generate it locally using the patched script.*

## Interpretation
The scan localizes where commitment happens. Observe the **Peak Lag** between architectures. If results show "No Dominance", refer to Experiment 02B for absorbing boundary calibration.
