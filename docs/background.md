# Background: The Post-Geometric Pivot

This repository represents a fundamental shift in research direction.

Prior studies investigated **activation-space geometry** (covariance anisotropy, manifold structure) as a potential constraint on model execution. However, these was largely falsified as operative explanations:
- Geometry was shown to be a **descriptive statistical regularity** useful for compression, but not an operative substrate for inference.
- Whitening and n-gram walker experiments demonstrated that the network does not "obey" its representation geometry during computation.

This motivates the shift to **Behavioral Probes**. We now investigate neural inference as a dynamical process of **information collapse**. The focus is no longer on how activations are arranged, but on the stability, irreversibility, and thermodynamics of the decisions they produce.
